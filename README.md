# Digital-Clock:

This is a simple and functional digital clock created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The clock displays the current time in a clean and modern format, updating in real-time.

# Technologies Used:

HTML: Used to structure the clock layout and define the elements.
CSS: Used for styling the clock, including fonts, colors, and layout to create an attractive visual display.
JavaScript: Used for fetching the current time and updating it every second, ensuring the clock always shows the current time.

# How-It-Works:

HTML: The clock is contained within an HTML element that holds the current time. This element is updated dynamically by JavaScript.
CSS: The CSS styles are used to make the clock visually appealing. It includes font styling, colors, background, and positioning to center the clock on the page.
JavaScript: The current time is fetched using the Date object in JavaScript. It is formatted into HH:MM:SS format, and the setInterval() function is used to update the clock every second.
